Write an HTML5 page that meets the following requirements:

    - [x] Raw only: Uses only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. External libraries like JQuery, React and Angular are not allowed for this exercise.

    Is a valid HTML5 page that is fluid (stretches with browser resizing), and contains:

    - [] toolbar that is snapped to the bottom of the browser spanning the entire width, containing four rectangles that act as buttons – two snapped to the left and two snapped to the right of the toolbar

    - []A form that floats in the center of the screen, even as the browser is resized

    - [] Avoids using CSS or other style declared inside of the HTML elements (artistic license is granted to you on style).

    - [] Avoids using on… attributes of HTML elements to define event handlers

    - [] Declares a JavaScript class using ECMAScript 6 class declaration syntax, with a constructor that accepts one or more parameters that are to be stored in the class

    Uses the bind function in the ECMAScript 6 class’ constructor to bind a method or methods of the class as event handlers for the following events:

    - [] Form submit event bound to the class’ onSubmit method – this must pop an alert message identifying the form that was clicked and must include the value of a property of the class that was passed into the constructor

    - [] Toolbar button click bound to the class’ onToolbarClick method – this must pop an alert message identifying the button that was clicked and must include the value of a property of the class that was passed into the constructor
